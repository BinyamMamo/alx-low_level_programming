Of all the hard things we have to do everyday, the most difficult one of them all is to keep going
For most of us, starting a project or anything in life isn't that hard but mostly we find ourselves not able to complete what we have started, because of impatience and lack of determination. In most cases we will find ourselves excited to start something with full energy but finally at the moment we should have fought hard we choose to give up and  stop what we have started.
In my case, I mostly find myself in these scenarioes. For example, when I try to learn some programming language like C++, at the beginning I become to eager to learn and do as much as I can but  after a while I find myself losing interest and finally comes a day when I will find it hard to keep going.
So in this project I want to get rid of this bad behaviour of mine and be more of determined and patient person.
